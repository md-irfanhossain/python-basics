# Simple Calculator (Python)

A simple Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

## How it works
- The program asks the user to enter:
  - the first number
  - the second number
  - the operation to perform (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`)
- Based on the chosen operation, the calculator returns the result
- If an invalid operation is entered, an error message is shown
